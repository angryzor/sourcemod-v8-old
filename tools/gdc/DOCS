This program checks SM gamedata in the given gameconf against the given server (not engine) binary.  It only checks vtable offsets and signatures.  It also only checks one gameconf per invocation.

Example usage:

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/steam/left4dead2/bin/ gdc -g left4dead2 -e l4d2 -f ~/sourcemod-central/gamedata/sdktools.games/engine.l4d2.txt -b ~/steam/left4dead2/left4dead2/bin/server.so

This will verify the gamedata in engine.l4d2.txt against the L4D2 server.so.

The parameters taken (in any order) are:
  -g <game name> 
  -e <engine name> 
  -f <gameconf file> 
  -b <binary path>

The file symbols.txt defines the extra information necessary to link up gamedata key names (like "CommitSuicide") with symbols (like "_ZN11CBasePlayer13CommitSuicideEv").  It also needs a "vtsym" key that contains the symbol name of the game's player class' vtable.  The symbols.txt itself is a gameconf file.
