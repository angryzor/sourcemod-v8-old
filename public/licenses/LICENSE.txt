0. Preamble

   This license is designed to address various issues that came up with AMX Mod X. 
SourceMod is Freeware and has fairly unrestrictive terms for redistribution.  You 
may use it commercially, but you may not sell SourceMod redistributions or 
derivatives.  

   Derivative works created with the SourceMod SDK are required to be licensed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL), unless with explicit written permission 
of AlliedModders LLC.  This affects both Extensions and Plugins.  A copy of the GPL 
is distributed in GPL.txt.
   
   While there are sections of this license that restrict your usage, there are
many entries to explicitly grant rights that were ambiguous with prior products.

2. LICENSE AGREEMENT

   The copyright owner and Licensor of SourceMod is "AlliedModders LLC."   
   SourceMod is Freeware, and does not require payment of any license fee.  
   This license is a binding legal agreement between the individual who downloads 
   SourceMod ("you") and the Licensor.  AlliedModders hereby grants you a 
   non-exclusive, transferable license to use SourceMod and its accompanying 
   documentation and source code.  As a condition for granting you a license to 
   download or use SourceMod, you agree to all of the Terms and Conditions.  
   If you fail to adhere to the Terms and Conditions, your license to use SourceMod 
   is automatically revoked without any action on behalf of the Licensor.

   This License may be updated at any time, without prior notice..  Each revision 
   is differentiated by a date version.  This License was created on Jan-27-2007.

   With this License, you may:

   a. Use SourceMod on any number of computers;

   b. Redistribute or copy SourceMod (subject to requirements in Section 3);

   c. Alter SourceMod files (both binary and text) for personal use;

   d. Disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise reduce SourceMod
      to human readable form for personal use, documentation, research, or to
      report bugs or security issues.

   e. Create derivate works using the provided SDK, subject to the SDK Terms 
      and Conditions (Section 4).

3. LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.  

   Redistribution granted in Section 2.b is subject to the following restrictions:

   a. You may alter certain files under the following restrictions:

     (i) You may not alter any binary object file for redistribution.

     (ii) You may alter any text, configuration, or database file, if you
          mark the files explicitly as altered from their original.

     (iii) SourceMod may come with files under their own licenses (for example, 
           the GeoIP database by MaxMind).  You must obey the licenses for
           third-party files.
   
   b. You may not sell SourceMod, alter its License, or sell/rent licenses to 
      third parties (by payment of money or otherwise).  

     (i) You may charge for the media transfer of its files only.
  
     (ii) You may not sell individual files derived from or directly from SourceMod
          without explicit written permission of AlliedModders LLC.

     (iii) You may sell or offer services related to installing, configuring,
           servicing, coding for, or troubleshooting SourceMod.

     (iv) You may sell or offer services where SourceMod is offered, permitted, or
          pre-installed on game servers you provide.  You may charge a nominal fee
          for such services in relation to SourceMod.  However, it must be clear 
          that you are not charging for a SourceMod License itself, but a service
          related to it.

     (v) You may sell or charge for the service of using SourceMod in-game or 
         remotely.  Such services are considered not to be related to SourceMod,
         but to the VALVe (R) Source Engine, and thus are not related to this
         License or its Terms and Conditions.

   c. You may not remove this or any copyright notice from SourceMod, or any files 
      distributed with SourceMod.  

   d. You may remove files or otherwise reorganize the SourceMod distribution
      as long as you explicitly mark it as altered from the original, and maintain
      all Copyright and License information.

4. SDK TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  

   You may create derivative works using the
   provided SourceMod SDK.  In order to create such works, you must agree to the
   terms and conditions below.  Failure to adhere to these conditions 
   automatically revokes your License to use the SourceMod SDK.

   a. You may redistribute the SourceMod SDK or any derivative works in object
      or source code form, provided you use one of the following open source 
      licenses.  In this case, "use" means "adhere to the terms and conditions of."
      The alternate license does not replace the SourceMod SDK License, but
      applies to your redistribution of the SourceMod SDK in altered form.

     (i) GNU General Public License ("GPL") Version 2 or higher.  A copy of the 
         GPL is provided in GPL.txt.  You are granted explicit permission to link
         your GPL SourceMod SDK code against both SourceMod and the Source SDK
         from VALVe (R).
     
   b. Usage of alternate licenses, terms, or conditions specified in Section 4.a 
      is not allowed unless given explicit written permission from AlliedModders 
      LLC.  You may, however, use more than one of the alternate licenses under a
      multi-license scheme.

   c. You may alter any file in the SourceMod SDK and redistribute as long as it
      is explicitly marked as altered, and all License or Copyright information
      remains unaltered.

   d. You may use the SourceMod SDK freely to write competing works, to reverse
      engineer SourceMod, or to otherwise write works unrelated to SourceMod, 
      under the normal conditions specified by Section 4.a.

5. NO WARRANTY

   BECAUSE SOURCEMOD IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY, TO THE

   WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
   OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES
