Notes:
 
 There is a possible compatibility regression from amb1684.  SetAdminPassword() 
 has been modified to remove any set password when given an empty string.  Previously, 
 a blank password ("") would force an admin to use "setinfo" to set an empty password, 
 but this functionality was deemed unuseful and unintended.  Blank passwords now 
 remove any set password.
