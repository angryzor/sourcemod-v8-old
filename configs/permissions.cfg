	 * By default, commands are registered with three pieces of information:
	 * 1)Command Name 		(for example, "csdm_enable")
	 * 2)Command Group Name		(for example, "CSDM")
	 * 3)Command Level		(for example, "changemap")
	 * You can override the default flags assigned to individual commands or command groups in this way.
	 * You can specify either a one-character, lower-case flag, or a named flag from "Levels."
	 * Examples:
	 *		"CSDM"		"i"
	 * 		"csdm_enable"	"j"
