 *
 * For each admin, you need two settings:
 *  "identity"		"permissions"		"password"
 *
 * For the Identity, you can use a SteamID, IP address, or Name (the type will be auto-detected).
 * For the Permissions, you can use a flag string or group (read below), and an optional password.
 *
 * There are 13 flags (a-i,z), and each flag has a specific meaning/role.
 * For example, the "b" flag means "kick permissions."
 *
 * You can combine flags into a string like this:
 * "abcdefgh"
 *
 * The default flags are:
 * 
 *		"reservation"		"a"		//Slot reservation
		"kick"			"b"		//Kick other players
		"ban"			"c"		//Ban other players
		"unban"			"d"		//Unban other players
		"slay"			"e"		//Slay other players
		"changemap"		"f"		//Change the map or gameplay type
		"cvars"			"g"		//Change cvars
		"configs"		"h"		//Run config files
		"chat"			"i"		//See dead/team chat and chat with other admins
		"votes"			"j"		//Display votes
		"password"		"h"		//Change server password
		"rcon"			"i"		//Use RCON
		"root"			"z"		//All permissions
 *
 *
 * Examples:
 *   "STEAM_0:1:16"		"bce"			//kick, ban, slay for this steam ID
 *   "127.0.0.1"		"z"			//all permissions for this ip
 *   "BAILOPAN"			"abc"	"Gab3n"		//name BAILOPAN, password "Gab3n": gets reservation, kick, ban
