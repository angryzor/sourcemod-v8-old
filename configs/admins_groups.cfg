	 * 1)Command Name 		(for example, "csdm_enable")
	 * 2)Command Group Name		(for example, "CSDM")
	 * 3)Command Level		(for example, "changemap")
	 * You can override the default flags assigned to individual commands or command groups in this way.
	 * To override a group, use the ":" character before the name.  Example:
	 * Examples:
	 *		":CSDM"		"i"		// Override the CSDM group
	 * 		"csdm_enable"	"j"		// Override the csdm_enable command
	 * Note that for overrides, order is important.  In the above example, csdm_enable overwrites
	 * any setting that csdm_enable previously had.
